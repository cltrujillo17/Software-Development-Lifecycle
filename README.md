# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves active communication with stakeholders to understand their goals and expectations, then translating these requirements into actionable tasks. The creation of user stories plays a crucial role in this process by breaking down complex requirements into manageable, user-centric increments. For example, in the SNHU Travel project, user stories such as "As a user, I want to search for flights based on budget" allowed the team to focus on specific functionality that directly addressed user needs. These stories provided clarity, ensured alignment with stakeholder priorities, and enabled iterative development that integrated continuous feedback, resulting in a product that closely matched client expectations.

# How do I approach developing programs? 
# What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs emphasizes iterative, user-focused development. Agile methodologies, particularly Scrum, have proven invaluable in structuring this process. Key practices include:

- Sprint Planning: Defining clear objectives for each sprint ensures that progress remains measurable and aligned with stakeholder goals.
- Daily Stand-Ups: Promoting regular communication to identify and address blockers promptly.
- Retrospectives: Reflecting on completed work to continuously improve team performance and workflows.

For future development, I plan to incorporate these practices, along with tools like Jira for backlog management and tracking progress. Agile’s flexibility to adapt to changing requirements and its emphasis on collaboration and customer feedback makes it an ideal framework for software development projects.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development involves active participation, effective communication, and a commitment to shared goals. During the SNHU Travel project, teamwork was exemplified by the Development Team’s collaborative efforts, such as resolving a database performance issue during daily stand-ups and supporting one another in completing complex tasks like integrating payment gateways. Good team members also embrace adaptability, as demonstrated when the team reprioritized the backlog to integrate a new feature for personalized travel recommendations without derailing the project timeline. A good team member contributes to a culture of mutual respect, accountability, and continuous improvement, ensuring collective success.
